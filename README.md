# Nomvia - Meet people who move.

> **Shipyard 2026 Hackathon Entry** | Brief: *Social App for Van-Lifers (Quin Gable)*

## About The Project

**Nomvia** is a social and utility app designed specifically for the nomadic community (van-lifers, digital nomads, and travelers). 

Built in public for the **RevenueCat Shipyard 2026** contest, this app answers the brief set by **Quin Gable**: *How do we solve loneliness on the road while keeping the community safe?*

Most dating and social apps are location-static. Nomvia is **location-fluid**, helping nomads find partners and friends who are moving in the same direction.

## The Core Problem
Living in a van is freedom, but it can be isolating.
* **Dating is hard:** You match with locals, but you leave town in 2 days.
* **Safety is key:** The community is small and protective, especially for solo female travelers.
* **Help is hard to find:** Finding a mechanic who understands solar setups or custom builds is a nightmare.

## The Solution: Nomvia
We aren't just building a "Tinder for Vans." We are building a trust-based network.

### Key Features (MVP)
* **Trust-First Onboarding:** A strict "Community Promise" and strict verification (photo of your rig/peace sign) to keep out creeps and bots.
* **Convoy Feed:** Don't just post status updates. Post your *route*. Find others driving from Mumbai to Goa on the same dates.
* **Builder Directory:** A marketplace to find vetted experts for electrical, solar, and carpentry help.
* **Connect:** Filter potential dates/friends by "Travel Pace" (Tortoise vs. Hare) so you match with people who move like you do.

## Tech Stack

* **Framework:** [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) (Expo Router)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Backend:** [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) (Database, Storage, Auth)
* **Monetization:** [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) (Subscription Management)
